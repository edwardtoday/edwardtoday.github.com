Skipped the classes today.

Then, Jerry "adopted" me. Talked a lot & ate much.

Called on Hippo in the evening.

A day without your face in sight or voice is a period of time so hard to kill.

Tomorrow will be another day. But still, you'd not be by my side.

I'm O.K.. I'll try to fill my life with French lessons and books.
