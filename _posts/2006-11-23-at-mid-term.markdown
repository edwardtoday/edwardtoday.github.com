Time flies... I've finished almost 1/8 of my 4 years in THU. The results of the maths exams might not be satisfactory. In fact, they were kind of a shame... Calculus~73 while the average is 82.1 in my class... Linear Algebra~86 a little bit higher but not enough cuz the average is... 86.9 I didn't know what happened when I was taking the calculus exam... why did i made that much mistakes in doing just simple sums or so? You might think that it was because of you, because of the time that i spent with you instead of with my textbooks. that's true. had i practised more, the mark must've been higher, but i do not want it. Study... i will try harder, read more, do more... however, i want you to know that these will never make me too busy to accompany you. I love u, Christina!
