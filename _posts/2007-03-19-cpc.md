One more has been "forced" to join CPC. Lucky not to be the one^^

Sounds so ridiculous that he's treated so because of using his laptop, in his room, during leisure time.

Till now I've never been seen working on mine in my room^^

What is the connection between breaking the rules and joining a party?

Actually, there's no such connection at all.

To be a much more powerful and influential party with more wise members, the party seems to be less human-centered.

An educated won't change his view of the party by force but by his observation.

Still thinking about this.
