Basketball match on Saturday morning 9:30-11:00

last week 27:25 won

Spring outing on Sunday morning 8:00-? which is in my charge... the Summer Palace, wish there'll be less people than i can foretell.

just now i was working on a debate_ museums in china should be free.

sounds like something right...

tonight... Physics assignments, help me, Einstein!

tomorrow a whole day's classes

the day after tomorrow...all the homework and course readers should be done

i wish i can make it so that we'll be able to go shopping (window shopping???) this Saturday afternoon^^

Ahh... I'm gonna turn to physics right now.
