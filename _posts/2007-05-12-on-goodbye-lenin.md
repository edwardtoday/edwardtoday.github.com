This movie is, rather than great, just a little thought-provoking.  
  
Is socialism(communism) that perfect?  

Was all the work worthwhile?  

Will I do so much for someone I love?  

...  
  
United we get power?  

Divided we have different beliefs in our minds.  
  
Time will see what'll happen here.
