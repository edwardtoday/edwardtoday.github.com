As planned, I went to rehearse Act 1 Scene 4 for tomorrow's performance tonight.  

Just once we did the King Lear thing but we talked for a while unlike last time when we all hurried to back to our dormitories.  

It was in this talk did I found that Xu had an offer from Yale and her bf (possibly, I think) one from Cornell.  

The two both are in the Department of Machinery (maybe... I did the translation). And what is important is that neither of them have a shining GPA. "Overall capability" is the key.  

Xu told me that it was kind of luck. The prof needed someone and she was the kind and contacted and admitted and scholarship and ... 6 years in Yale.  

An open and smiling girl with a face hardly telling her age...  

On the road.  
  
Future...
