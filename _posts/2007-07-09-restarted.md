Now I have a reason to write in English, don't I^^

the first day of the english camp is kind of a failure to raise my interest.

nothing exciting (i don't know what's going to be in the next few days, but today, it is dissatisfying)

the teacher and the volunteer are both good

but there is definitely something wrong with the organization

with no one breaking the ice, we'll be kept waiting and wasting a lot of time later on

i tried

i'll keep trying tomorrow

see ifÂ there's any difference at that moment...
