Oh, wordpress.com accessible in mainland now~

This is my third day in office.
Monday : filling forms, reading manuals and c++ style guide...
Tuesday : reading source code of previous engine
    and something else.
Wednesday : reading source code till now

It seems we are going to take a project from Electronic Arts soon. Not sure if I'll be assigned to that team.

I'm back to wordpress, leaving the live space for a while.
