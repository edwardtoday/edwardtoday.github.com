Mac apps are known for beautiful graphical user interfaces and good human-computer-interaction design. Some, however, are still better than their competitors, at least from my point of view.




Here are a list of apps I use often that are highly recommended.




[Adium](http://adium.im/)




Instant messaging.




MSN, QQ, Google talk, Facebook, twitter, etc.




Supports encryption.




I use this for texting. Video chats? Go for Skype.

[AppFresh](http://metaquark.de/appfresh/)




Find updates of installed applications and let you download/install these updates with a single click.

# [Carbon Copy Cloner](http://www.bombich.com/)




Incremental backup. Using rsync as backend. Fast and stable.

# [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/)




FTP client. I tried Transmit and ForkLift and finally chose this one.

# [Dropbox](http://db.tt/ZPyUSwT)




This is fabulous. Best online storage / syncing / sharing tool I have ever used.




Automatically syncs everything in the Dropbox folder.

# [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/)




Sync your notebook among devices. Access them as long as you have an internet connection.




I use Evernote for Windows, Mac, iPhone/iPad and Blackberry.

# [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm)




The built-in screen shot is very powerful, but video capture is missing before QuickTime X came into being. Screenflow is a powerful screen recorder and its video editor is really handy. BTW, the recorded data takes little space compared to tools like Fraps on Windows.

# [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/)




PDF reader. Faster than Adobe Reader. Very useful notes feature which does not alter the content of the original file. A good tool for reading papers.

# [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/)




GTD tool. Syncs with iCal and iPhone client.




![Things.png](http://edwardtoday.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/things.png)




# [Versions](http://versionsapp.com/)




Award winning Subversion client. As DVCS is more popular these days, try MacHG and Gitbox, though I find CLI faster and more stable than GUI tools.




![Versions.png](http://edwardtoday.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/versions.png)




# [Welly](http://code.google.com/p/welly/)




Terminal app I use for BBS.
