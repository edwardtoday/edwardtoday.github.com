Mac apps are known for beautiful graphical user interfaces and good human-computer-interaction design. Some, however, are still better than their competitors, at least from my point of view.

Here are a list of apps I use often that are highly recommended.

[Adium](http://adium.im/)

Instant messaging.

MSN, QQ, Google talk, Facebook, twitter, etc.

Supports encryption.

I use this for texting. Video chats? Go for Skype.

[AppFresh](http://metaquark.de/appfresh/)

Find updates of installed applications and let you download/install these updates with a single click.

# [Carbon Copy Cloner](http://www.bombich.com/)

Incremental backup. Using rsync as backend. Fast and stable.

# [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/)

FTP client. I tried Transmit and ForkLift and finally chose this one.

# [Dropbox](http://db.tt/ZPyUSwT)

This is fabulous. Best online storage / syncing / sharing tool I have ever used.

Automatically syncs everything in the Dropbox folder.

# [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/)

Sync your notebook among devices. Access them as long as you have an internet connection.

I use Evernote for Windows, Mac, iPhone/iPad and Blackberry.

# [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm)

The built-in screen shot is very powerful, but video capture is missing before QuickTime X came into being. Screenflow is a powerful screen recorder and its video editor is really handy. BTW, the recorded data takes little space compared to tools like Fraps on Windows.

# [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/)

PDF reader. Faster than Adobe Reader. Very useful notes feature which does not alter the content of the original file. A good tool for reading papers.

# [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/)

GTD tool. Syncs with iCal and iPhone client.

# [Versions](http://versionsapp.com/)

Award winning Subversion client. As DVCS is more popular these days, try MacHG and Gitbox, though I find CLI faster and more stable than GUI tools.

# [Welly](http://code.google.com/p/welly/)

Terminal app I use for BBS.
