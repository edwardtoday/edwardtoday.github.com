			<p>I am a MSc student in software technology at the Department of Computing, <a href="http://www.polyu.edu.hk/" title="香港理工大學">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a>. My supervisor is <a href="http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdzhang/" title="张大鹏">David Zhang</a>. I am associated with <a href="http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~biometrics/" title="人體生物特徵識別研究中心">Biometrics Research Center</a> at HKPU. </p>
			<p>My current research interest include: pattern recognition, image processing and biometrics.</p>
			<p>I worked for <a href="http://www.virtuosgames.com/">Virtuos Games</a> as a software engineer during 2010 and 2011. I crafted games for PS3, Xbox360, Wii and also for iPhone/iPad.</p>
			<p>Before that, I have been studying computer science at <a href="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/" title="">Tsinghua University</a> where I graduated in July 2010. My BA thesis "Real-time parallel decoding of multi-view coding video" was supervised by <a href="http://media.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/sunlf" title="孙立峰">Lifeng Sun</a>.</p>

			<p>I've owned the domain <a href="http://qingpei.me" title="qingpei.me">qingpei.me</a> since 2011. It was a Wordpress mirror of <a href="http://edwardtoday.wordpress.com" title="my wordpress blog">my wordpress blog</a> with all my earlier posts from Windows Live Spaces.</p>
			<p>In Feb 2012, I switched to GitHub Pages and Jekyll. Having a static site is good. Having all my posts version controlled using git is even better. Not to mention the benefits of writing in markdown.</p>
			<p>I decided to make this site more than just a blog in June 2012. With Twitter Bootstrap, the site became more readable especially on mobile devices.</p>
